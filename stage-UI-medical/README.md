# Medical AutoML Assistant

This project provides a user-friendly web interface for medical professionals to easily train, evaluate, and use machine learning models without requiring any background in data science or coding. The system is powered by [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/) and includes a conversational assistant (LLM) to guide the user through each step.

## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* pip
* Recommended: Virtual environment (venv)

---

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
SSH : git clone git@github.com:mathfrancois/UI_medical.git 
HTTP : git clone https://github.com/mathfrancois/UI_medical.git
cd UI_medical
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Groq API Key Configuration

This project requires a Groq API key to function. **Do not share your own API key** publicly. Each user should create their own.

1. Sign up and obtain your API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following lines :

GROQ_API_KEY= your_api_key
FLASK_DEBUG=1

3. Make sure the `.env` file is **not pushed to the repository** (add it to `.gitignore`).

### Run the Application

```bash
flask run
```

Then open your browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## How to Use

### Training Tab

1. **Upload a CSV training dataset**
2. **Preview the dataset** and optionally remove columns and fill missing value
3. **Select the target column** (to predict)
4. **Set a training time limit (seconds)**
5. **Click to launch training**
6. **Review the results**:

   * Table of performance metrics
   * Model leaderboard
   * Confusion matrix and ROC curve (for classification)
   * Feature importance from AutoGluon and SHAP beeswarm plots
7. **Download the trained model (.zip)**

### Prediction Tab

1. **Upload a trained model (.zip)**
2. **Upload a new dataset (CSV)**
3. **Run predictions**
4. **Preview results and download the output CSV**

## Built-in Chatbot (LLM Assistant)

The assistant helps medical staff by:

* Explaining how to use the interface (column selection, preprocessing, etc.)
* Describing performance metrics and graphs
* Suggesting improvements to the dataset
* Helping understand why a model performs well or poorly
* Interpreting SHAP plots and feature importance

This assistant is designed to work with **non-technical users**.

## Example Workflow

1. Upload `patients.csv`
2. Choose `disease_outcome` as the target
3. Set training time to 300 seconds
4. Launch training
5. Review SHAP/ROC/matrix results
6. Download the best model
7. Upload `new_patients.csv` for prediction
8. Download predictions
